OS Used: Ubuntu 19.04
Language Version: julia version 1.0.3
Compiler Used: N/A
Enviroment: Uses IJulia and Jupyter to create an interactive enviroment for 
            running and testing code. We specifically liked the ability to test 
            and modify individual sections of code without the need to recompile.
